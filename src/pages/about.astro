    <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
    <p>
        My first exposure with programming was probably Scratch around the 6th
        grade where I was just dragging blocks. The block dragging was annoying
        and I quickly dropped this programming thing. The next time I picked up
        programming was years later in AP Computer Science where I learned Java
        right before the beginning of the Covid Pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the class did not inspire much enjoyment it opened me up to the
        depth of programming and its potential. When I wrote a language
        translation program in Python it was my proudest moment. Hours went by
        without me noticing as I improved the program and even added a GUI. I
        started wondering how everything on my computer worked and how the
        websites I used were built. These questions naturally led to me majoring
        in Computer Science at UCSB.
