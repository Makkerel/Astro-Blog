    <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
    <p>
        My first exposure with programming was probably Scratch around the 6th
        grade where I was just dragging blocks. I think the block dragging back
        fired in way because I got bored of it quickly and didn't get much into
        it. I really regret this decision. The next time I picked up programming
        was years later in AP Computer Science where I learned Java right before
        the beginning of the Covid Pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the class did not inspire much enjoyment it opened me up to the
        depth of programming and its potential. When I first wrote a functional
        translation script in Python everything finally clicked. Hours past
        without me noticing as I improved the program and even added a GUI. I
        started wondering how everything on my computer worked and how the
        websites I used were built. These question naturally led to me majoring
        in Computer Science.
