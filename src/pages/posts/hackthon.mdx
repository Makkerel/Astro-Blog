I went to <Link link="https://sb-hacks-xi.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge" name="SBHacks XI"/>
which was the first ever hackathon have ever participated in. I went
with 3 other guys and that was my team for the hackathon. They all
taught me brand new things about programming that I had no idea of
until the hackathon. In general the hackathon really opened my eyes
to how much I really needed to learn. It was 24 hours of pretty much
just programming and the fun I had was something I had not expected
## The Acutal Project
We decided to create a housing app for our school UCSB. The housing
app would be an aggregate of all the listed housing around Isla
Vista that could be found from different websites. As such there
were two major parts to this project that we really wanted to
perfect the frontend user interface and the way we were able to get
our information.
### The Backend
The aggregation technique we used was an AI powered web scraper that
used 3 main technologies that would link together to form a pipeline
that would generate CSV files of housing information for us. The
first technology used was Selenium which allowed us to simulate a
browser where we would then take screen shots of the pages on
different housing apps. After taking the screenshot the image would
then be fed into a software called Sycamore made by one of the
sponsors of the Hackathon Aryn AI. Sycamore would then parse thought
the screenshots and create CSV files from the images. Finally the
CSVs would be fed through Claude.AI to remove any errors in the
CSVs. This information would be then sent from out backend Django
server into our frontend.
### The Frontend
The Frontend was really not that difficult to implement aside from
the fact that we decided to used Svelte and Sveltekit as our
frontend framework. We decided on this because one of our team
members believed it to be the best for the fast pace of a hackathon
compared to something like React. I had to pretty much learn it as I
went and I was quite the interesting experience working with a
framework that was much less verbose than React. I thoroughly
enjoyed my time with it and will probably be using it in the future.
The actual frontend was in many ways just a more focused version of
google maps but it did look really nice. The actual project can be
seen on <Link link="https://devpost.com/software/homelessgaucho" name="Devpost"/>
## The Challenges
By far the most difficult thing about the hackathon was learning the
new technologies that I was just not at all experience with. From
simply installing the software to actually using it I was met with a
whole host of difficulties. The way everything was setup I had to
install a package manager called Scoop for Windows that I had no
knowledge of until that day and it has really improved my Windows
experience ever since. From Scoop I would then need to install a
package manager for JavaScript technologies called pnpm. This was
literally just for the installation of Svelte and Sveltekit.
However, even though it was hard I now know of some great useful
tech for the future. I also learned about front and backends and how
the connect with each other a lot better now and even learned that
there is a new Python package manager called uv.
## The Conclusion
Our team finished the hack around 4:30 am in the morning and I was
so completely out of it but I had to get up at around 8 to head in
to start doing demoes and try to win a prize. My teammates
didn&#39;t show up at first and I pretty much had to deal with all
the logistics of the project by myself. We were lucky in that we
demoed a lot later than some other teams which gave time for one of
my teammates to show up. In the end we won an award of 500$ for best
use of Aryn AI Software. After the hackathon I slept for about 4
hours in the afternoon. I really enjoyed my time and will probably
try to go to another hackathon in the future. I thought it was gonna
be constant coding for the 24 hours but it was actually much more
chill. We coded and talked and learned all at the same time. I
highly recommend SBHacks to anyone that may be looking to
participate in a hackathon as well. The hosts were great and the
environment welcoming. All I can say is 10/10 would hack again.
