Around midnight on Friday, July 21st, 2023 a paper was uploaded to
<Link link="https://arxiv.org/" name="Arxiv"/> an online archive of research
papers. I was probably sleeping at the time and an event like this was
nothing unusual. It was not published anywhere and the authors were not well
known. No one should have cared about this preprint and yet the entire world
would soon be driven into frenzy. Why? Because it claimed to have discovered
the holy grail of material science, a room temperature superconductor called
LK-99. In the simplest terms, the paper was claiming the new material would
be in essence a replacement for copper. Superconductors are materials that
perfectly conduct electricity unlike a material like copper which will lose
a bit of the electricity as it passes through. Pretty much all electronics
would become more efficient with a room temperature superconductor.

By Wednesday of the following week, all my social media from Reddit to
Twitter had someone talking about LK-99. One tweet had over 3 Million Views!
Maybe it was the release of ChatGPT months earlier or just the desire for
change due to the pandemic but it was this discovery that transfixed the
public like few had before. Yet the claim of this superconductor was
unproven and quickly started the rollercoaster that was the scientists from
around the world scrambling to replicate the findings of the paper.

Major national and university laboratories rushed to be the first to confirm
the findings. The Wikipedia page for LK-99 even had an entire section that
was being updated to show the status of replication for different labs. This
entire situation, to put it lightly, was odd as usually, labs would
patiently wait on one another or until the paper was actually properly
published but here it felt like a competition. The reason for this was the
fact that based on the paper it felt that anyone and their grandma could
seemingly reproduce LK-99. The process outlined was almost too simple and
only needed copper phosphate and lead sulfate which many scientists already
had lying around their lab. Some more chemically savvy public members even
announced that they would attempt to DIY the material by themselves within
their homes. Some of these DIYers would stream or tweet their progress
online for all the world to witness.

Indeed the draw of LK-99 was that it was cheap and a room temperature
superconductor. It was so simple to make that many scientists felt wrong to
not at least attempt to replicate the findings. The public&#39;s desires for
results were answered when on August 1st, 2023 a video on the Chinese social
media platform BiliBili showed what was claimed to be
<Link link="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14p4y1V7kS/" name="LK-99 levitating"/>.
Levitation is a sign of the Meisner effect where it expels all magnetic
fields causing levitation above magnets. This effect is a property of all
superconducting materials but is not unique to superconductors. The
levitation of LK-99 would change public sentiment from skepticism to faith
as it felt more real than ever. However, it was not all sunshine and
rainbows as buried within the maelstrom of posts on the levitation were the
troubling posts of LK-99 being a facade of superconductivity. The hype
though would prevent these revelations from gaining traction for quite some
time.

The floating rock was enough for the public to be convinced and I don&#39;t
blame them because the effect was straight out of science fiction and it
didn&#39;t help the discourse promoted the idea that it was a silver bullet.
After the first week of August not a single lab showed an abrupt drop to 0
electrical resistance. Electrical Resistance is generally just how well an
object can conduct electricity and a sudden drop to 0 resistance is what
defines a superconductor. The hope of the public waned as no conclusive
evidence was published. The final nail in LK-99&#39;s coffin came on August
16th, 2023 in an
<Link link="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02585-7" name="article by Nature"/> that
showed it was not a superconductor. LK-99 was an insulator or a
material that actively stops electricity from being conducted through it.
The reason that it was thought to be a superconductor was because it
contained impurities from the creation process causing the superconductive
effects and the inconsistent results from different labs. It was fool&#39;s
gold for material scientists that resolved quite anticlimactically.

So it was all a misunderstanding from a paper that hadn&#39;t even gone
through peer review right? Science for the public is about the big
discoveries and this discovery was simply a dud but there are far more
beneath the surface left to uncover. The true story of LK-99 lies not in the
material but in the people behind it. While it cannot be proven to be
malicious the graphs in the paper from the very beginning were suspect and
the actions of the authors throughout are strange. Questions arise like why
would a scientist fake findings or claim a lie? What is the point of risking
your reputation by bypassing the normal process? What is the normal process?
The partial answer lies in the system in which papers are selected and
published and it all starts with an innocent question of who uploaded the
paper anyway.
## Misconduct or Mistake?
The two major scientists for LK-99 are Sukbae Lee and Jihoon Kim whose
initials are where the material&#39;s name is derived from. However, these
two people, while both being the first authors or the primary people behind
the paper, were not the ones who uploaded the paper. The situation is
strange as there were two papers uploaded to Arxiv about LK-99 but the
papers were completely different. The first paper that caused the initial
hype was uploaded by Young-Wan Kwon while the 
<Link link="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037v1" name="second paper"/> uploaded
by Hyuntak Kim doesn&#39;t even include Kwon as an author.

It is completely normal to edit and change papers before being published but
having two completely different papers from one another that don&#39;t even
have the same authors is extremely unusual. Hyuntak Kim even said the first
paper by Kwon was uploaded without his permission and had many defects.
Kwon&#39;s motivations remain unclear but from the outside, it feels that
Kwon was trying to steal a bit of the acknowledgement by having his name on
it compared to the other paper. No matter the reason this is not proper
conduct whatsoever and casts doubt on the entire discovery if the
researchers can&#39;t even get the authors straight. Aside from the upload
oddity, the graphs in the second version uploaded by Hyuntak Kim also have
defects.

According to Professor Philip Moriarty from the YouTube channel 
<Link link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl-AgmoZ5mo"name="Sixty Symbols" /> the
presentation of data is almost laughable. In the graph above the units
on the y-axis are too big to show 0 resistivity of LK-99. He pointed out how
even a &quot;first year physics textbook&quot; would tell you the units
should have been 10^-8 cm, not 10^-2 cm. Furthermore, a superconductor is
supposed to have a sudden drop to a resistance of 0 that the graph
doesn&#39;t actually show and instead shows a slow eventual drop to what
seems to be 0. The odd drop-off is already strange but the wrong units are
just unacceptable for a paper done by researchers.

The authors promised to fix the mistakes and claimed better results that
proved without a doubt it is a room temperature superconductor but it&#39;s
2025 and their promise has still not materialized. The consensus on this
debacle is that they should&#39;ve just had the paper published and gone
through peer review. The answer is always apparently just peer review but
why is it so important and would it have prevented LK-99 from happening?
## What's the Deal with Peer Review?
The common solution that every scientist comes up with when it comes to
cases like LK-99 is to just not care about papers until it has been properly
peer reviewed and published in some scientific journal. Peer review is
always thrown around as the answer and is considered fundamental to the
scientific system but surprisingly this process is not as clearly defined as
one would think. Generally speaking peer review is where a paper is
thoroughly checked and vetted by another scientist working in the same
field. The scientist would then say if the paper is indeed good or if it
needs edits. Simple right?

This definition is on the surface reasonable but there is no clear ruleset
for peer review. The matter is instead decided by the journal that would
publish the paper. In 
<Link link="https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/editorial-criteria-and-processes" name="Nature"/> a
well known scientific journal, the editors will first pick the papers that
seem to be most intriguing, and then once selected the editor will choose
scientists to peer review the paper. There are usually 2-3 reviewers and all
of them are volunteers not paid by Nature. The editor gets to make all the
decisions regarding who to send it to and the reviewers stay anonymous
unless they willingly reveal themselves. After receiving feedback the editor
will make a final decision on whether to publish or not. It&#39;s clear that
for a process so core to the scientific system it feels oddly unscientific
and arbitrary.

According to a 
<Link link="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-020-00092-1" name="study on peer review"/> by
Jonathan P. Tennant and Tony Ross-Hellauer there is very little
scientific research done on peer review. The paper concludes that many
aspects of peer review don&#39;t have enough scientific data to support or
undermine them. Worryingly, the paper also points out how peer review often
feels like a black box where what exactly happens during peer review is
unclear. There are no rulesets for everyone to follow and journals are free
to change practically anything they want. The situation worsens as the job
of peer review is extremely undervalued and scientists that do the reviews
may not have the baseline skills necessary to conduct a proper review.
In fact, LK-99 may be a demonstration of the issues with the inconsistency
of peer review. According to the 
<Link link="https://n.news.naver.com/article/366/0000920152" name="Sukbae Lee"/> one
of the main authors did try to publish their findings in Nature but were
required to publish in another specialized journal. Lee then subsequently
had it published in a <Link link="https://doi.org/10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061" name="domestic academic journal"/>
in April before the initial uploads to Arxiv. This means that LK-99 did have
peer review but it wasn&#39;t able to prevent the event from occurring.
While I am speculating, the shoddy peer review may have given Kwon the
confidence to upload that first paper on Arxiv. This case illustrates that
not all peer review is created equal which begs the question, how can peer
review be improved so it is the answer to cases like LK-99.
## How Do We Improve?
The question of how to fix these problems has no clear answer but there are
a couple of fundamental reforms that I think need to happen to improve the
system. The peer review study believes that there needs to be more rigorous
research done on peer review. I agree that peer review should not be put on
a pedestal and needs to be an established field of research just like other
topics in science. I also think that peer review should be disconnected from
journals where every journal has to follow a core set of rules for peer
review. In this way, I feel that peer review won&#39;t have to feel as much
like a black box as it currently does.

These are only some possible changes and other suggestions may be even more
effective but my point is to draw attention to the fact that there are holes
in the current established system that should not be ignored. Science is an
iterative process and that includes the way science is conducted itself.
Hopefully, in the future, the process will be so refined that when there is
a new LK-99 people won't have to be skeptical and instead simply be
ecstatic.
